Distributed intelligent system for oil tank storage

Distributed system design to manage contexts, entities, relationships, activities and events, Based on Context-driven approach to modeling distributed systems. Allows for communication between entities via JSON messaging. Generates rules based on activity of the system.

### Example:

The system is installed in oil tank storage. On each oil tank there are different sensors measuring the tank's temperature and pressure. Sensors are communicating within one tank and the entire system of tanks. If the measures exceed a predefined norm, an alert is sent out to security in order to protect the storage from potential explosion or leakage. 

The system is design for an ongoing monitoring of tank storage and with each measure the context of the system is updated to ensure maximum security.
